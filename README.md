## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

## What is it?

- Organizing software around date and objects
- Combining related attributes and functions into container objects
- Not related to a language
- A way to program

## why use it?

- Encourages Organization
- Easier to understand
- Reusable
- Allows us to build large applications

## OOP's Main Goals:

- Organize Code
- Easier Code
- Clear & understandable Code
- Easy to Explore
- Easy to Maintain
- Memory efficient
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

## OOP's Principles:

- Abstraction (Hide something for simplicity from the user).
- Encapsulation (Keep properties and methods private. That will not work outside of the class).
- Inheritance (Child class will take matching properties, value and methods from the parent class).
- Polymorphism (This will behave many ways. A child class can overwrite a method that inherited from the parent class).

## Alternative methods to OOP:

- Functional Programming
- Structured or modular Programming
- Imperative Programming
- Declarative Programming
- Procedural Programming

## Why use OOP instead of others?

- Most using and widely use programming paradigm for large project and complex project.
- OOP is more flexible and easy to maintain.
- OOP is more secure and easy to update.
- OOP is more efficient and easy to understand.

## How Object-Oriented structure in Programming?

- Class (Blueprint)
- Object (Instance of a class)
- Method (Function)
- properties (key & value)

## There are three way to make a object in OOP:

- Factory Function
- Constructor Function
- Class
- Object.create()

## What is Classes?

- Template for creating objects, providing initial values and implementing behavior(methods).
- Encourages reusability.

## Class Inheritance:

  Extending data and methods from another class.
